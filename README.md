## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A graduate from University of Adelaide with a Bachelor of Mathematical & Computer Sciences majoring in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Teaching, I've had a life-long passion for technology. Currently a student at 42 Adelaide, working to rapidly complete the 42 Common Core by early 2025, and working through [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/jthughes), I'm looking to enter the software development industry.
